# README

dfc is a simple tool that display file system space usage using graph and color

## BUILD

simply use make:

	make

## RUN

Once built, you can run it by typing:

	./dfc

see ./dfc -h for options and usage

## INSTALL

By default, it will be installed in /usr/local/bin. As root, type:

	make install

If you want to override this, change the prefix.
For instance:

	make PREFIX=/usr install

## CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration file found in conf/dfcrc needs to be placed here:

	$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dfc/dfcrc

If your operating system does not support XDG Base Directory Specification it
can then be placed in this directory:

	$HOME/.config/dfc/dfcrc

Or, last choice, directly in $HOME (but the name has to be preceeded by a dot):

	$HOME/.dfcrc

## INFORMATION FOR PACKAGERS

Here is the list of dependencies:

  * glibc

Yep, that should be it. :)
If you package it for a BSD system, note the Makefile should be BSD make
compliant so there is no need for gmake. If not, feel free to inform me.

	make

Once built, you can run it by typing:
	./dfc

CONFIGURATION FILE
The configuration file found in conf/dfcrc needs to be placed here:

If your operating system does not support XDG Base Directory Specification it
can then be placed in this directory:

Or, last choice, directly in $HOME (but the name has to be preceeded by a dot):
	$HOME/.dfcrc

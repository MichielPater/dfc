# README

dfc is a simple tool that display file system space usage using graph and color

## BUILD

cmake is required in order to build dfc.
I suggest you create a build directory to compile dfc but this os of course not
required.

Create the build directory:

	mkdir build

Navigate into it:

	cd build

Run the cmake command to generate a Makefile that works for your OS:

	cmake ..

Now you can use the make command to build dfc:

	make

The dfc binary will be placed into a bin directory.

Note: if you do not want to build translation, you can use the following at the
cmake step:

	cmake .. -DNLS_ENABLED=false

## RUN

Once built, you can run it by typing:

	./dfc

from within the directory where dfc is situated.

see ./dfc -h for options and usage

## INSTALL

By default, it will be installed in /usr/local/bin. As root, type:

	make install

You can also choose some standards parameters like where the files need to be
installed. This needs to be done when using the cmake command.
Example (from the previously created build directory):

	cmake .. -DPREFIX=/usr -DSYSSCONFDIR=/etc -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE

Then run the 'make install' and it will install dfc according to what you chose
in previous step.

## CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration file found in conf/dfcrc needs to be placed here:

	$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dfc/dfcrc

If your operating system does not support XDG Base Directory Specification it
can then be placed in this directory:

	$HOME/.config/dfc/dfcrc

Or, last choice, directly in $HOME (but the name has to be preceeded by a dot):

	$HOME/.dfcrc

## INFORMATION FOR PACKAGERS

Here is the list of dependencies:

  * glibc

Yep, that should be it. :)

Of course, cmake is a build dependency.

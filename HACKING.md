Patches are welcome!

Just keep in mind the following:

  * keep the same coding style
  * use c89 (the only exception being for using uint64_t type)
  * your code must fit in 80 columns wide with a TAB of 8
  * always check what a function returns if it is non-void. If you do not care
    about what is returned, explicitly declare it by casting it to void.
  * preferably use 'git format-patch' to generate your patch

You can send your patch via email to the author:

.TH dfc 1  "April 1, 2012" "version 2.4.0" "USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
dfc \- display file system space usage using graph and colors
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dfc [OPTION(S)] [-c WHEN] [-u UNIT] [-t FILESYSTEM]
.SH DESCRIPTION
dfc(1) is a tool similar to df(1) except that it is able to show a graph along with the
data and is able to use color (color mode is "color-auto" by default but you
can change this with "-c" option).

The available size correspond to the space available to a user point of
view and not from root's perspective (ie: use f_bavail instead of f_bfree).
In the same idea, used space is computed simply by substracting the available
space from the total size.

Without any argument, size is displayed in human readable format.
Be aware that when using human-readable format, there might be some rounding
when computing the size. If you want maximum precision, use the "-u"
option and choose the unit.

dfc(1) also has a built in feature that makes the output auto adjust based on
terminal width. If you want to override this behavior, use the "-f" option.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-a
Show information about all file systems found in the mtab file.
.TP
\-b
Do not show the graph bar.
.TP
\-c [WHEN]
Choose color mode where WHEN is one of the following sub-option:

"always":
	Color will always be used, no matter what stdout is.

"auto":
	This is default when "-c" is not activated. Color is used only if "stdout"
is a terminal. For instance, color will be disabled with this option if you
pipe the output of dfc(1) into another command.

"never":
	Color will never be used.

.TP
\-f
Override auto-adjust behavior by forcing information to be displayed.
You probably do not want to activate this option but choice is yours.
This option may be useful if you pipe the output of dfc(1) though.
.TP
\-h
Show a short help text.
.TP
\-i
Show information about inodes.
.TP
\-m
Use SI units (metric) (ie: size is computed using powers of 10 instead of powers
of 2).
.TP
\-n
Do not print header.
.TP
\-o
Show mount options.
.TP
\-s
Sum the total usage.
.TP
\-t [FILESYSTEM]
Allows you to perform filtering on file system type. FILESYSTEM could take any
known file system value. For instance, "ext4", "ufs", "tmpfs", "reiserfs", etc.

Multiple selection on file system is also possible. In this case, FILESYSTEM
needs to be comma separated (without spaces). For instance, if you want to
filter "ext4" and "tmpfs", you would use the following:

	dfc -t ext4,tmpfs

You can also use negative matching to filter the output. To do so, you just
need to prepend a "-" to FILESYSTEM. In the following example, dfc(1) will
display all file system type except those mentionned:

	dfc -t -rootfs,tmpfs

.TP
\-T
Show filesystem type.
.TP
\-u [UNIT]
Show size using unit specified. UNIT can take one of the following value:

"h":
	Human readable (default when not using "-u" option).

"b":
	Show bytes.

"k":
	Show size using Kio.

"m":
	Show size using Mio.

"g":
	Show size using Gio.

"t":
	Show size using Tio.

"p":
	Show size using Pio.

"e":
	Show size using Eio.

"z":
	Show size using Zio.

"y":
	Show size using Yio.

NOTE: When using "-u" option along with "-m" option, those suboptions are
replaced by their SI counterparts.
.TP
\-v
Print dfc(1) version and exit.
.TP
\-w
Use a wider bar.
